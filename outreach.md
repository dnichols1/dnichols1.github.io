As part of my current and previous NSF grants,[^1] I put together two different outreach projects, which are linked below.
The first on visualizations of spacetime curvature is work that generalizes some research I performed during my PhD, which is also summarized in the post [here]({% post_url 2012-12-19-vortex-and-tendex %}).
The second is writings about gravity that mix creative works with pedagogical explanations.
The aims of these two works are explained in more detail on the respective pages.
