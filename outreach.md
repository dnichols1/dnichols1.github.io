As part of my current and previous NSF grants,[^1] I have developed (and continue to develop) three different outreach projects, which are linked below.
The first on using visualizations of spacetime curvature as a method of conveying the complex physics and mathematics of general relativity in a simpler, visual perspective.
The second is writings about gravity that mix creative works with pedagogical explanations.
The third on visualizations of spacetime curvature is work that generalizes some research I performed during my PhD. 
More details about the visualization method is described in the post [here]({% post_url 2012-12-19-vortex-and-tendex %}).
The aims of these projects are explained in more detail on the respective pages.
