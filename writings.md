As part of my current NSF grant,[^1] I proposed to mix creative and pedagogical popular-science writing together as a way of trying to engage a different group of readers who are more inclinced towards reading literature rather than standard popular-science works.
My first effort in this direction is linked below.
It is a brief overview of some of the surprising properties of non-rotating black holes with an introduction through a short poem that frames the subsequent, more pedagogical narrative.
Future writings on other topics in gravitation will also appear here, once they are prepared.
