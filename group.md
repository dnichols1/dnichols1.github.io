Below are current and former group members and advisees. I do not anticipate having sufficient funding for a PhD student or postdoc during the upcoming application cycle, though I am happy to support applications for fellowships to work in my group. For UVA undergraduate students, I can guide unfunded undergraduate research projects (including PHYS 3995), such as the one described on the UVA SPS website, [here](https://spsatuva.github.io).
