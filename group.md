Below are current and former group members and advisees. I do not anticipate having support for a PhD student or postdoc during the upcoming application cycle, though I am happy to support applications for fellowships to work in my group. I can, however, guide undergraduate research projects and senior theses. You can contact me by email to inquire about open positions in the group.
