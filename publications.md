When it is up to date, I think of my [CV](/cv.pdf) as the most complete and accurate source for my publications.
Below is a list of other locations where you can find lists of my publications:

* [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/nichols_d_1)

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pP8GDzwAAAAJ&hl=en)

* [INSPIRE](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AD.A.Nichols.1)

* [NASA-ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22nichols%2C%20david%20a%22%20year%3A2008-2019&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)

* [ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4758-9460)

These links have different levels of completeness and accuracy compared with the publication list in my CV.
In case it helps your searching, note that I publish as David A. Nichols for my short author-list papers, but as D. Nichols as part of larger collaborations.
