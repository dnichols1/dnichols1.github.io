My research focuses on gravitational waves from strongly gravitating astrophysical objects.
I am interested broadly in what gravitational waves can teach us about fundamental physics, astrophysics, and the dynamics of compact objects.
The posts below highlight some specific research themes and papers on which I have worked.
