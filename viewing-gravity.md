The fundamental insights from relativity can be stated without using the advanced mathematics (differential geometry or tensor calculus) that underlie the formal articulation of the theory.
Nevertheless, these concepts describing the fundamental properties of relativity are difficult to ponder given their abstract nature.
For example, space and time are best described as a single four-dimensional continuum, spacetime; energy, momentum and stress all warp this spacetime fabric; and bodies move through this curved spacetime by following the closest analog to a straight-line path.[^1]

This page is part of an ongoing effort,[^2] which has been given the name "Viewing Gravity" to use visualizations to investigate and convey the nature of gravity in general relativity as a way to circumvent the difficulties of mathematics and the limitations of words in understanding the nature of general relativity.
It builds upon several papers described in a research effort which is summarized in the following post on this website [(here)]({% post_url 2012-12-19-vortex-and-tendex %}).
It also relies upon modifications to the visualization method described in that post.
These are summarized on the webpage, [(Visualizations of Spacetime Curvature)](/visualizations/), and this new method made animating the spacetime geometry much more tractable.

The visualizations aim to highlight the two key physical effects of curved spacetime that cannot be eliminated through a judicious choice of measuring lengths or times elapsed (in a more technical language, setting up a locally inertial reference frame).
First is relativistic tidal effects, which stretch an object in one direction and squeeze in two perpendicular directions (or vice versa) through a relative acceleration.
The new visualization method highlighted how these stretching and squeezing effects change throughout space by showing them as red (stretching) or blue (squeezing) line segments distributed throughout space; the relative size of the icons at each point indicated the scale of the stretching and squeezing at each point, and a translucent color showed the relative magnitude of the stretching and squeezing effects at different points.
Second is a relative rotation effect, which tells how space gets dragged into motion compared with nearby points.
Its effects are visualized using the same method as with tidal effects, but the directions now refer to the axis of rotation at each point (with red denoting counterclockwise rotation and blue clockwise), and the translucent colors indicate the size of the relative rate of rotation at different points.

[^1]: John Archibald Wheeler famously summarized the last two aspects of the theory as "Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve" assuming, of course, the reader was familiar with the notion of spacetime.
