Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia [(UVA)](https://www.virginia.edu/) in Charlottesville.
My appointment began at the end of July of 2019 and my profile on the UVA Physics Department's webpage can be accessed [here](https://www.phys.virginia.edu/People/personal.asp?UID=dn2ep).

From July 2018 to July 2019, I was a senior postdoctoral researcher in the Gravitation Astroparticle Physics Amsterdam [(GRAPPA)](https://grappa.amsterdam/) institute at the University of Amsterdam [(UvA)](https://www.uva.nl/en/home) in The Netherlands. 
I was part of the gravitational-waves research group there, which is being led by Associate Prof. [Samaya Nissanke](https://samayanissanke.wordpress.com/).

From September 2016 to June 2018, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Astrophysics](https://www.ru.nl/astrophysics/) at Radboud University [(RU)](https://www.ru.nl/en) in Nijmegen in The Netherlands. 
The Department of Astrophysics is part of the larger Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics, and Particle Physics [(IMAPP)](https://www.ru.nl/imapp/) at Radboud. 
My research adviser there was also Associate Prof. Samaya Nissanke.

Before moving to The Netherlands, I was a postdoctoral research associate working in the research group of Prof. [Eanna E. Flanagan](https://physics.cornell.edu/eanna-flanagan) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).
I worked in the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science (CCAPS), which is affiliated with the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.cornell.edu/). 
I held my position at Cornell between September 2012 and August 2016.

Prior to my postdoc at Cornell, I worked on my Ph.D. in the theoretical astrophysics group [(TAPIR)](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). 
My doctoral advisor was Prof. [Yanbei Chen](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~yanbei/), and I also worked closely with Emeritus Prof. [Kip S. Thorne](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/). 
I graduated in June 2012, and I spent the summer as a postdoc finishing up some remaining projects from my Ph.D.

My undergraduate studies took place at Claremont McKenna College [(CMC)](https://www.cmc.edu/), where I majored in both mathematics and physics. 
My senior thesis research was in the field of mathematical biology, and it was guided by Prof. John Milton. 
I graduated in June 2006.
