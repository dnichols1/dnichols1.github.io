This post summarized three white papers to which I contributed, one about the European Space agency (ESA) mission Athena 
and the other two related to the ESA/NASA mission LISA, the Laser-Interferometer Space Antenna.

## Summary of the Papers ##

In the past few years, I contributed to these three white papers on different aspects of multi-messenger and gravitational-wave (astro)physics 
that will be possible with the Athena and LISA missions.
The first paper on Athena focused on what one can learn from multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars and black-hole--neutron-star binaries 
with future ground based detectors (such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope) and x-ray observations of the electromagnetic emission from these mergers using the Athena mission.
The most promising avenues were understanding the demographics of the x-ray afterglows from gamma-ray bursts.
Measuring precursor flares or the prompt emission from the merger, as well as x-rays from the kilonova could even be possible.
