I had the pleasure of appearing on the podcast Hoos in STEM hosted by UVA Mathematics Professor [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono) twice now. 
The first time I discussed some properties of black holes and gravitational waves for a not very technical audience.
I was joined by my colleague in the Physics Department [Marija Vucelja](https://www.marijavucelja.com/) who discussed her work in statistical mechanics and the Mpemba effect.
You can listen to the episode on 
[Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/uvas-physicists-are-studying-black-holes-and/id1671045329?i=1000633572901) or
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1lKPLhO1LD4jD5A5p0HIb6).
The second time was at an event hosted at Carr's Hill (the residence of UVA President Jim Ryan), which was co-organized by [The Story Collider](https://www.storycollider.org/).
I told the story of how I realized I wanted to do theoretical rather than experimental physics.
The Dean of UVA's Medical School [Melina Kibbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melina_Kibbe) and [Karen McGlathery](https://environment.virginia.edu/mission/people) told stories at the event that are also on the podcast.
