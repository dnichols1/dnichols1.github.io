## Summary of the Paper ##

Finding a definition of the angular momentum of an isolating gravitating system has a long and involved history.
Over several decades of (sporadic) work on the topic, a number of different researches used different methods to converge on an expression for the quantity. 
However, there were still several different definitions used in different subfields, which were not clearly equivalent.
It was subsequently noted that there are in fact a two-parameter family of angular momenta that generalize many of the existing definitions.
This two parameter family satisfies a number of physically reasonable conditions.

With UVA graduate student Arwa Elhashash, we found that one condition that the two-parameter family did not satisfy was that it vanished in flat spacetime.
Imposing this requirement forced the two parameters to be equal, which left a one-parameter family of angular momentum (and the different definitions used in the various subfields were all consistent with this one-parameter family).
We then explored how large the difference in definitions is for binary-black-hole mergers.
For nonspinning binaries, the difference in the (orbital) angular momentum for the definitions is illustrated in the figure above.
The figure shows that the definitions agree at early times and after the gravitational waves pass, but there is a difference when the system is radiating gravitational wave most strongly.
The difference is also largest for equal mass ratios (q=1).
We also investigated a one-parameter family of super angular momentum, a kind of generalization of angular momentum.
For the super angular momentum, there is again a difference between the definitions, but this difference lasts after the gravitational waves have passed (which occurs because of the graviational-wave memory effect).
The amplitude of the differences in the (super) angular momentum are small, but they can be resolved by numerical simulations of binary-black-hole mergers.
