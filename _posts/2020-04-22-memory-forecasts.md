## Summary of the Paper

The gravitational-wave luminosity of a black-hole binary at its peak can be as high as a few thousandths of the fundamental unit of luminosity&mdash;the speed of light to the fifth power divided by Newton's constant (c<sup>5</sup>/G)&mdash;the so-called Planck luminosity.
One consequence of this high luminosity is that asymmetries in the distribution of energy radiated in gravitational waves produces secondary gravitational waves.
Aspects of the gravitational waves produced through this mechanism are called the gravitational-wave memory effect, because they lead to a lasting change in the gravitational-wave strain that endures even after the gravitational-waves have passed.
This lasting strain is typically a small fraction (around a twentieth) of the peak amplitude of the gravitation waves, and it is currently below the threshold of detection for individual binary-black-hole mergers.
However, it had been shown previously that one could find statistical evidence for the gravitational-wave memory effect in a population of binary black holes like that of the first event detected, GW150914.
For a population of these events, it was shown it would take fewer than one-hundred such events to find statistical evidence for the memory effect.

Subsequent gravitational-wave detections showed that the population of binary-black-hole mergers had a much wider range of distances and masses than the first event.
Thus, Oliver Boersma in his MS thesis (supervised by Patricia Schmidt and me) investigated how long it would take for advanced LIGO and Virgo to detect the memory effect from a population of binary black holes that was consistent with the population inferred from the first gravitational-wave catalog of events (GWTC-1).
We found that the it would take closer to five years of observing runs (assuming the three detectors were operational in coincidence for half of the time) for LIGO and Virgo to detect the gravitational-wave memory effect.
This is illustrated in the figure above, which shows how the signal to noise in the population (roughly the significance of the observation in units of standard deviations), accumulates as a function of time.
Given the rate of events, it is then anticipated that it will take closer to one thousand detections to find evidence for the gravitational-wave memory effect.
It is thus more likely to be discovered during the next upgrade of the LIGO and Virgo detectors after the detectors achieve their design sensitivity (when LIGO A+ and Advanced Virgo+ are operating).
