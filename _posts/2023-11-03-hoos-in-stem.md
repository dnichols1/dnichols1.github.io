I recently had the pleasure of appearing on the podcast Hoos in STEM hosted by UVA Mathematics Professor [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono). 
I discussed some properties of black holes and gravitational waves for a not very technical audience.
I was joined by my colleague in the Physics Department [Marija Vucelja](https://www.marijavucelja.com/) who discussed her work in statistical mechanics and the Mpemba effect.
