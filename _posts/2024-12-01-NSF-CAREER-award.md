I am pleased to announce (belatedly) that I received an NSF CAREER Award back in December 2024.
The full abstract for the award is on the NSF website [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2439893).
A less technical summary of the project, written by the communications staff at UVA is [here](https://as.virginia.edu/uvas-david-nichols-wins-nsf-career-award-gravitational-wave-research).
