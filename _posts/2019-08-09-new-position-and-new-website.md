On July 25, 2019, I moved from the University of Amsterdam (UvA) in the Netherlands to begin a new position as an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville.
I am excited to begin teaching and starting my research group at UVA!

I also took this as an opportunity to update my website to a more modern format.
I have joined the many people who use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme.
