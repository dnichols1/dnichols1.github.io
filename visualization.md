The warping of empty spacetime in general relativity is described mathematically in terms of quantities known as curvature tensors.
The effects of curvature can be understood most simply on families of observers who synchronize their clocks.
As described in more detail in the post [here]({% post_url 2012-12-19-vortex-and-tendex %}), the tensors at an instant of time can be broken into two matrices throughout space, which measure the tidal stretching and squeezing between two observers for one and the relative rate of precession of gyroscopes for the other (the so-called electric and magnetic parts, respectively).

The animation on this page illustrates the stretching and squeezing effects of the electric part of the curvature in one plane of a spacetime that has an axis of rotational symmetry pointing up in the image (all other planes would therefore look identical).
Physically this spacetime represents the generation of weak quadrupolar gravitational waves that would come from a system such as the ringdown following the head-on collision of two non-rotating black holes.

The animation visualizes two different kinds of quantities (a still from the animation is shown above). 
The short lines throughout the plane show the characteristic directions of stretching (red lines) and squeezing (blue lines) that nearby observers would experience (more precisely, they are the two eigendirections in the plane; the third eigendirection pointing perpendicularly out of the plane is not illustrated).
The two lines are always perpendicular, and the relative length of the lines indicates the relative amplitude of the stretching and squeezing effects.
The gray color throughout the plane illustrates the magnitude of the larger of the stretching and squeezing effects at each point, and it is normalized by the largest amount of stretching or squeezing throughout the plane at the initial time shown (more precisely, it is the larger, in magnitude, of the eigenvalues corresponding to the illustrated eigendirections normalized by the largest eigenvalue throughout the plane at time zero).

The area visualized contains the near region close to the oscillating quadrupole source, and it illustrates how the changing curvature close to the center (or origin) of the plane induces changes in the curvature further away.
Within about one gravitational wavelength, the curvature induced by the oscillations near the center propogate outwards as gravitational waves. 
The amplitude of the stretching and squeezing effect falls off rapidly as the distance from the center increases.
The gravitational waves measured by LIGO and Virgo are frequently a billion billions (10<sup>18</sup>) gravitational wavelengths away. 
Thus, the amplitude of the waves is significantly weaker once they reach the Earth.[^1]
